**A Python project using pandas to explore bikeshare data.**


### Date created
April 22, 2022


### Project title
Bikeshare Udacity project

### Project Overview
This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform descriptive analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

### Running the program

You can input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this program. I use Anaconda's command prompt on a Windows 10 machine.


### Program Details

The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option)

Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

- Most popular month
- Most popular day
- Most popular hour
- Most popular start station
- Most popular end station
- Most popular combination of start and end stations
- Total trip duration
- Average trip duration
- Types of users by number
- Types of users by gender (if available)
- The oldest user (if available)
- The youngest user (if available)
- The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

- The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

### Requirements

- Language: Python 3.6 or above
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, time
